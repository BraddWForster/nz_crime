Code that pulls together New Zealand crime statistics from NZ Police.

See https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/statistics-and-publications/data-and-statistics/demand-and-activity for data source.

Note: Downloading the data can be a real challenge due to its size. I had to download Tableau first to get it to work.
